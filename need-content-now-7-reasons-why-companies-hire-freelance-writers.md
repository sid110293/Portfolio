## Need Content Now? 7 Reasons Why Companies Hire Freelance Writers

When a business needs help creating more content, but doesn’t have the ability to hire more full-time employees, freelancers can bridge this gap. The gap between a company’s haves and needs can be an extreme pain point that limits growth. Freelance writers are highly skilled in their niche and can provide tremendous value to your business. 

Your company may be hesitant to contract out work. Continue reading to learn 7 reasons freelance writers can be a great asset to your company and why your competitors have already made the jump:

### 1. Reduce Overhead 

Your company may not have the budget to hire a full team of expert writers, editors, content strategists, and designers. Freelancers are highly-skilled masters of their craft, offering writing expertise, to those willing to pay. And can you believe they cost less than a full-time employee? Your company needs to provide FTE’s with competitive benefits and salaries, including health insurance, retirement, and paid time off. That’s the price of finding and recruiting great talent. Experienced freelancers may command higher hourly rates than FTEs but you will have little to no overhead and will only be paying for the content. 

### 2. Flexibility

By hiring freelancers, your company can cultivate relationships with new writing professionals. If your company finds a freelancer that produces great results and there is a high-level of team compatibility, a full-time offer can be extended. This can be a great method to recruit new employees, because by working with them beforehand, you already know their strengths and weaknesses. When a freelancer isn’t a good match you can end the working relationship at any time or at the end of the contract. 

Additionally, project needs change often and unexpectedly. By incorporating freelancers you adaptively resize your workforce to grow or shrink with the project.

### 3. Limited Onboarding

Onboarding a new employee is expensive and companies can spend thousands of dollars getting a new employee up-to-speed and trained. In the wake of the Great Resignation, your company wary of investing in employees that are likely to job hop. If an employee leaves within the first few years, the investment in training and onboarding is lost and more money must be spent for a new employee. A freelancer doesn’t cost nearly as much to onboard and train, reducing risk for your company. 

### 4. Specialized Talent

Companies often look for a broad skill set when choosing FTEs. A full-time employee will be tasked with adapting to different projects and teams. This doesn’t apply for freelancers. The rest of the freelancer’s skills aren’t as important as the niche you need content for.

Your company may need a subject matter expert for a niche skill or topic. Instead of recruiting FTEs for this work, you can contract that work out with a freelancer.  Full-time employees will save significant time not having to research and learn this new niche and can focus on their other assigned tasks. 

### 5. Improved Turnaround Times

Freelancers have experience working with a variety of clients, on a variety of timelines. By contracting out work, you can see improved turnaround times for your deliverables. Freelancers usually work a few projects at a time and work in short time frames. Say you want an article on a current hot topic, a freelancer may be able to deliver in only a matter of days, whereas your full-time employee already has a backlog of requests and ongoing work. Quick high-quality deliverables will pay off big time for your company. 

### 6. Easy to Find

Your company can find freelancers quickly and efficiently. An estimated 42% of the American workforce, or 67 million Americans, are freelancing part-time this year. That is a massive talent pool to chose from. You can easily post job openings on sites such as [Fiverr](fiverr.com), [UpWork](upwork.com), [Problogger](problogger.com), and others. Freelancers will apply or bid on your projects and you can search through applications to find the freelance writer that best fits your needs. 

### 7. Flexible Schedule & Remote Work

The majority of freelancers work from home meaning you can recruit freelancer writers that live anywhere. Your company needs last-minute content to respond to an emerging issue? Because freelancers work by the hour or per word, they can come to your rescue, even after hours. If you need work completed on the weekends or late at night, your full-time salaried employees are unlikely to be receptive to a request for immediate work. Freelancers know they can capitalize on short deadlines and are usually happy to help in these situations. 

## Ready to Hire?

If your company wants to publish more content then you need more writers. To solve this problem you can hire more full-time employees or you can decide to try something new. The payoff can be huge. Once your company recognizes the immense value skilled freelancers provide, then it’s time to act. Have your recruiters reach out to promising individuals on LinkedIn. Create a business account with UpWork and you can be placing freelance jobs in no time. Make sure to set a competitive rate to field interest from high-quality candidates. If you select Fiverr, you can browse freelancer gigs in your area of interest and even select from Fiverr Pro candidates. The candidates are nearly endless, so bring in some fresh writing talent and get the articles rolling.
