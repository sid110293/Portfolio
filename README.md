This repository with include technical writing pieces that I can share publicly, as well as blog posts from my personal website. 

## Breakdown

Most of the articles contained in this repository do not contain any client information. If you would like to see more examples of my work, please reach out. 

I complete all background, SEO, and keyword resaerch as needed to fulfill a client's needs. Sometimes a client insits on documentation formating that I may not prefer. I've created dozens of troubleshooting guides, user documentation, product updates, and much more.
